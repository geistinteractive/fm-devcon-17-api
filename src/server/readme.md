# Server

The server is "infrustructure".  It doesn't change much, if ever. It is responsible for  listening for requests, and sending responses back to the clients.

It has very little todo with the specfics of any given API.  It handles only the things that don't change from project to project

It serves Swagger APIs nothing more.
